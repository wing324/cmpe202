# Summary

I re-implement Chain of Responsibility design pattern to Lambda.

I used 5 classes to implement Chain of Responsibility design pattern by regular code, but I just use 1 class which just has 25 lines code to implement Chain of responsibility by using lambda. So lambda code is more concise than normal Java code, but it is more difficult to understand.
